# Stock Modelling

-------

### Objective: Explore Drivers of Stock Movement

##### Data: [Nasdaq Link Data](https://data.nasdaq.com/)
##### Methodology: Use combination of fundamental metrics, retail activity, and short interest to project price movements, assign probability to future date outcomes, and flag (+notify) of stocks meeting highly predictive criteria.

These models can serve as places to start digging, but maybe with enough testing, an effective betting strategy.
There are only two ways to 'out-perform' an efficient market ->

1) Have access to better/more information (we are not this, but more than retail *perhaps*)
2) Find creative solutions, features (we hope to be this, i.e. use data differently)

To-do List:

    - Exploration + Data Understanding (add to research folder where applicable)
    - Analysis
    - Iteration
        - baseline model w/ clear prediction goals
        - thorough documentation of model versions 
    - Automation
        - This will likely need to to include free server space for running py scripts/notebooks (daily)
    - App/Notification System
        - see above about hosting running scripts + plotly apps
